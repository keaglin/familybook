<!-- ## Reflection

#### About 
This was initially a project built over 3 days to wrap up Unit 2 of my Web Development Immersive cohort at General Assembly DC. I built it to demonstrate knowledge of backend engineering techniques learned during Unit 2.  
I initially set out to build an API with a separate frontend (which I've now done as of this writing on 3/6/18). The project was inspired by my wife's idea to make and bind a physical book. I thought a website would make the information more accessible and easier to disseminate.  
#### Technologies Used
I used the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack to build this project because it's what we've been using so it was easy to translate to my use case for this project. I initially wanted to use Pug because I had positive experiences with Pug (when it was Jade) in the past but I severely underestimated how much time I spent reading documentation and experimenting to get things functional, especially with regard to passing in data from my controller. With the time given, I decided to switch back to Handlebars because I could accomplish the same functionality and hit my deadline.  
This app was previously deployed as a MEHN app to Github Pages but I used Surge for the React app because it's quick and easy. Github Pages is excellent for static sites but I needed a hosted backend for this particular project so Heroku was an easy choice. I used mLab to host the database and used an environmental variable to connect it. -->
